                <h1>Hey! I’m Canao ReyCyrus, a competitive PUBG Mobile player and In-Game Leader (IGL).
I love the energy of every match — the tension, the teamwork, and the challenge of making quick, smart calls that keep my squad alive.

For me, being an IGL isn’t just about giving orders; it’s about trust, timing, and staying calm when things get intense.
I enjoy planning rotations, setting up plays, and keeping everyone focused no matter how wild the zone gets.

I’ve been part of the competitive scene for a while now, and every game teaches me something new — about strategy, teamwork, and even myself.
At the end of the day, I just love the grind, the wins, the losses, and the rush that comes with chasing improvement.
