                <h1>Hey there! I’m Canao ReyCyrus, a PUBG Mobile player and In-Game Leader (IGL) who’s all about strategy, teamwork, and the rush of competition.
I started this page to share a bit of what I do — from leading my squad through tough zones to pulling off those clutch wins that make every game worth it.

Gaming has taught me a lot — not just about aiming or tactics, but about communication, trust, and staying calm under pressure.
If you’re into that same drive to get better and enjoy the grind, then you’ll fit right in here.</h1>
